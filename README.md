# Kobe Bryant Shot Analysis

#### Description:
This is a flask app in which I analyze shot data for NBA legend Kobe bryant in order to understand his shot selection. Additionally, I use ML to predict the whether a particular shot will be a miss or a make.

Libraries  used:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- scikit-learn/XGBClassifier (for ML)


I downloaded data from Kaggle that included every shot that Kobe Bryant ook in his career. I then used Python libraries such as numpy and pandas to curate and clean the data. Then I used the matplotlib library from Python to plot the data in a manner that would make it easy to visualize Kobe's shot selection. This Flask webapp also includes a JavaScript component since I wanted to add asynchronous loading of certain plots via AJAX calls.
