# Kobe Bryant Shot Analysis
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/AAP91l9lILI
#### Description:
This is a flask app in which I analyze shot data for NBA legend Kobe bryant in order to understand his shot selection.

I downloaded data from Kaggle that included every shot that Kobe Bryant ook in his career. I then used Python libraries such as

numpy and pandas to curate and clean the data. Then I used the matplotlib library from Python to plot the data in a manner that

would make it easy to visualize Kobe's shot selection. This Flask webapp also included a JavaScript component since I wanted to

add asynchronous loading of certain plots via AJAX calls.
